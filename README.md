# HousePrices
In this Program We use data from a CSV File to predict house prices based of linear regression and output it in a graph using Matplots. The columns are transaction year, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, longitude, house price of unit area. By using this info we can ask the user which column would you like to see its regression and by doing this it will plot out points and make a line. I had alot of fun making this program and i really hope you enjoy!!
